Simple bash script to automate the transform images from the Kodak PIXPRO SP360
into an equirectangular format that is understood by https://pannellum.org/

The crop values might be different for your specific Kodak PIXPRO SP360 camera.
They can be adjusted in the PUXPROpano.sh file (ref. crop_values_25498235).

The author of this project is in no way affiliated with Kodak. In fact this
was done because the author hates the original Kodak software. It is stupid!
Bad quality export (high compressed JPEG). Not batchable! Windows or Mac
only! Everything that you never want!



How it works
============
PUXPROpano.sh
-------------
usage: ./PUXPROpano.sh <input image> <output without jpg extension>

Requires:
    exiftool
    nona, enblend  (hugin)
    bash, sed, rm
    convert (imagemagick)

Converts the dome/fisheye <input image> from the Kodak SP360 to equirectangular
image file <output without jpg extension>.jpg

The crop values might be different for your specific Kodak PIXPRO SP360 camera.
They can be adjusted in the PUXPROpano.sh file (ref. crop_values_25498235).

To batch convert a bunch of files:
	for file in $(ls *.JPG); do ./PUXPROpano.sh ${file} $(basename ${file} .JPG)_pano; done

PUXPROpano.sh extracts the orientation of the SP360 from the EXIF data and tries to
rotate the image appropriately ... however, in some (currently one) cases the
orientation tag is useless, because it does not report whether the camera is upside down
or not. Hence sometimes PUXPROpano.sh fails. In such case you must manually rotate the
panorama image created.


generate_gallery.sh
-------------------
Generates a html image gallery using pannellum.htm from https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum
Please get the latest pannellum.htm from https://github.com/mpetroff/pannellum

To generate a html gallery named gallery.html for all images ending in _pano.jpg in the
current directory you would do:

	./generate_gallery.sh *_pano.jpg > gallery.html


Demo
====

100_0454.JPG and 100_0561.JPG are two images from a SP360.

100_0454_pano.jpg and 100_0561_pano.jpg where generated via

	for file in $(ls *.JPG); do ./PUXPROpano.sh ${file} $(basename ${file} .JPG)_pano; done

100_0454_thumb.jpg, 100_0561_thumb.jpg and gallery.html where generated via

	./generate_gallery.sh *_pano.jpg > gallery.html

But why?!
=========
The Kodak PIXPRO SP360 is a wonderful camera. It allows to take panorama pictures with ease.
I find those panoramas ofter an excellent way to capture places - far better than can be
done via a regular camera. E.g. a DSLR will only capture a small section of what you would
usually see. Doing regular panoramas takes time and sucks ... with the SP360 - click - and
you are done. No need to turn around in a circle worrying that someone stepping into the image
could ruin your panorama and thus make you turn another circle, etc.

The main problem with the PIXPRO SP360 is the software provided by Kodak ... its the worst
thing I have ever seen. - That's all I will say about it.

PUXPROpano is a free and open source solution, combining and adapting existing free and
open source solutions to work with the SP360.

... more things planned: video conversion, automatic 360 x 180 image (and later video)
stitching (utilizing a 3D printed 360 x 180 mount), 3D video, adapt pannellum to display
SP360 images directly, ...
